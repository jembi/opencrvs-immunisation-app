      <h1>Rwanda Case-based Surveillance Demo</h1>
      <p>
        This is a mockup application that demonstrates a possible workflow for
        case-based surveillance in Rwanda. It focusses on showing how duplication
        of patient records can be minimized through the use of a national Master
        Patient Index (MPI). It follows OpenHIE principles for patient management
        as well as for saving clinical data (i.e. CBS events) to a Shared Health
        Record.
      </p>
      <p>
        The MPI uses fuzzy matching techniques to accurately search for patients
        to minimise the creation of duplicate client records. The MPI in use is a
        FHIR server developed by Jembi Health Systems. This FHIR server also acts
        as a Shared Health Record which stores CBS events.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Please note:</b> this demo is public and no real patient data should be
        entered. A large number of test patients have been pre-loaded into the
        MPI to allow you to see the fuzzy matching in action.
